# MEAN_Intro
This is an exercise to practise creating an app using MEAN-- MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular6 and NodeJS. You will develop a simple web application named StartPitch that allows users to pitch ideas about Start-up. A start-up pitch includes information about the title of the idea, a short description, a type describing the industry or market it belongs to, from a list of at least 5 pre-defined choices (Health, Technology, Education, Finance, Travel). In order to submit an idea, a user needs to be registered. The user can do so by providing a name, an email address (that serves as a login) and a password.
